# Run the ingestion scripts in this order.

1) download-vlrs.py
- This downloads all the pdfs specified by the vlrs-<DATE>.csv file.

2) ingest.py
- This uses the Anthropic API to perform OCR on the pdfs downloaded in the previous steps.

3) embed.py
- This uses the OpenAI API to create embeddings of the chunks generated by the ingestion step.

4) concat-csvs.py
- This uses the OCR text and embeddings, which were written to disk during the previous steps, and concatenates them into a format that we can upload to Supabase.

5) Manually upload CSV files generated by step 4 into the correspondingly-named Supabase tables.
